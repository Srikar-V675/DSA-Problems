# Problem Definition

**Leetcode Link:** [Valid Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/description/)

Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
```

Example 2:
```
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
```

# Approach

- It is a easy approach if you understand the problem at hand. If you think of it as just comparing the frequencies of each character in string that way we can solve the problem.
- We can use two hashmaps to count the frequency of characters in each string and return True if the hashmaps are equal else False.

# Solution

**Time Complexity:** O(N)
**Space Complexity:** O(1) - because no matter what the hashmap can have a maximum of 26 characters as that is the number of lower case characters.

```python
map1 = {}
map2 = {}
for ch in s:
    if ch in map1:
        map1[ch] += 1
    else:
        map1[ch] = 1
for ch in t:
    if ch in map2:
        map2[ch] += 1
    else:
        map2[ch] = 1
return map1 == map2
```
