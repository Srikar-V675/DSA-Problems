# Problem Definition

**Leetcode Link:** [Container with Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)

**Solution Link:** [Neetcode](https://youtu.be/UuiTKBwPgAo?si=FBBeDg_J1mPFqF_b)

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

Example 1:

![alt text](image-7.png)
```
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
```

# Approach

- We need to find the max Area, for that we need two numbers that are almost equal or have least difference and are far from each other.
- In order to choose the right one we know, if we have 2 numbers: 2 & 8 then we need to get rid of 2 or move to next element other than 2 if we can find a greater number closer to 8.
- Since we want maximise the distance between 2 numbers we need to have 2 pointers one at each end of teh array.

# Solution

**Time Complexity:** O(N)
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

```python
maxArea = 0
left = 0
right = len(height) - 1
while left < right:
    if height[left] < height[right]:
        maxArea = max(maxArea, (right - left) * height[left])
        left += 1
    else:
        maxArea = max(maxArea, (right - left) * height[right])
        right -= 1
return maxArea
```
