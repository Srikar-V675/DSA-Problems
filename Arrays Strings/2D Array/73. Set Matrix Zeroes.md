# Problem Definition

**Leetcode Link:** [Set Matrix Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/set-matrix-zeroes/submissions/1383001500/)

**Solution Link:** [Neetcode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T41rL0L3Pnw)

Given an m x n integer matrix matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0's.

You must do it in place.

Example 1:

![alt text](DSA-Problems/Arrays%20Strings/2D%20Array/image.png)
```
Input: matrix = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]
Output: [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,0,1]]
```

Example 2:

![alt text](DSA-Problems/Arrays%20Strings/2D%20Array/image-1.png)
```
Input: matrix = [[0,1,2,0],[3,4,5,2],[1,3,1,5]]
Output: [[0,0,0,0],[0,4,5,0],[0,3,1,0]]
```

# Approach

**Brute:**
- Let's talk about the brute force approach.
- We can create a copy of the original matrix, since they have asked to update the 0's in place we can traverse the copy matrix and update the original matrix if you find 0 accordingly.
- But the problem is we are using O(n\*m) extra space but we can do even better.

**Better:**
- In this approach, instead of using a whole copy of matrix we can use just 2 extra arrays of size N and size M.
- We can traverse the original matrix and update the appropriate rows and cols that have O in the array.
- Then we can look into these 2 arrays and update the appropriate elements based on which rows and cols must be converted to 0.
- We can still do better by making use of just constant space.

**Optimal:**
- We can notice that the extra 2 arrays we used in previous approach are just an extension of the first row and first column.
- But we have a slight problem since the index matrix\[0]\[0] collide there can be problems when we have to update only the first row or only the first col to 0.
- To tackle this we can consider the `row0` as a variable i.e constant space.
- Now we can traverse the array and update the appropriate first row and first col to 0 if the element is 0. We only run into a problem where one of the elements in the first row is 0 then we need to check if that element is in the first row then we can update the `row0` variable.
- After this we can again traverse the entire matrix and see if the corresponding row must be zero or col must be zero then update current element to zero.
- Then we can check if the matrix\[0]\[0] is set to zero, then that means that the whole first column must be converted to zero.
- If `row0` then we know that the whole first row must be converted to zero.

# Solution

**Time Complexity:** O(m.n)

**Space Complexity:** O(1)

```python
row0 = False
ROWS, COLS = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
for i in range(ROWS):
    for j in range(COLS):
        if matrix[i][j] == 0:
            matrix[0][j] = 0
            if i == 0:
                row0 = True
            else:
                matrix[i][0] = 0

for i in range(1, ROWS):
    for j in range(1, COLS):
        if matrix[i][0] == 0 or matrix[0][j] == 0:
            matrix[i][j] = 0

if matrix[0][0] == 0:
    for i in range(1, ROWS):
        matrix[i][0] = 0

if row0:
    for j in range(COLS):
        matrix[0][j] = 0
```
