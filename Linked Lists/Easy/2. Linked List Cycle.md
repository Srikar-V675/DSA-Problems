# Problem Definition

**Leetcode Link:** [Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/description/)

**Solution Link:** [Neetcode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBTe7lFR3vc)

Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.

Example 1:

![alt text](DSA-Problems/Linked%20Lists/Easy/image-2.png)
```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
```

Example 2:

![alt text](DSA-Problems/Linked%20Lists/Easy/image-3.png)
```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.
```

Example 3:

![alt text](DSA-Problems/Linked%20Lists/Easy/image-4.png)
```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

# Approach

- We can use the `Floyd's Tortoise and Hare` method.
- Which says we use 2 pointers: one slow and one fast.
- The slow pointer moves one position and fast pointer moves two positions every step. If there is a cycle then after n steps both slow and fast pointer are the same.
- This is true because everytime (if there is a cycle) slow moves one place, fast moves two places to close the gap by 1 (if cycle exists).
- if no cycle exists then fast reaches the end first and we can return False.

# Solution

**Time Complexity:** O(n)

**Space Complexity:** O(1)

```python
slow = head
fast = head
while fast and fast.next: # fast.next too because if fast reaches last node and no cycle exists.
    slow = slow.next
    fast = fast.next.next
    if slow == fast:
        return True
return False
```
