# Problem Definition

**Leetcode Link:** [Generate Parenthesis](https://leetcode.com/problems/generate-parentheses/description/)
**Solution Link:** [Neetcode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9fokUqJ76A) 

Given n pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses.

Example 1:
```
Input: n = 3
Output: ["((()))","(()())","(())()","()(())","()()()"]
```

Example 2:
```
Input: n = 1
Output: ["()"]
```

# Approach 

- This problem is clearly a **recursion** problem.
- In my initial approach, I mapped out the decision tree for generating valid pairs of parentheses, identifying three scenarios starting with `op = n` and `cl = n`:
    1. If `op == cl`, then you can only add an opening bracket.
    2. If `op == 0`, then you can only add a closing bracket.
    3. If `cl > op`, then you can add both opening and closing brackets as two sub-scenarios.
- Where I went wrong was not ensuring that `op` did not go below `0`. This oversight, particularly in the condition `cl > op`, caused an infinite loop.

```python
def generate(op, cl, combi):
    if op == 0 and cl == 0:
        res.append(combi)
        return
    if cl == op:
        generate(op - 1, cl, combi + '(')
    if op == 0:
        generate(op, cl - 1, combi + ')')
    if cl > op:
        generate(op - 1, cl, combi + '(')
        generate(op, cl - 1, combi + ')')
res = []
generate(n, n, "")
return res
```

- For the optimal approach, we need to make some changes:
    - We recognize two scenarios:
        1. When you have opening brackets to spare (i.e., `op > 0`), you can add an opening bracket.
        2. When you have more closing than opening brackets (i.e., `cl > op`), you can add closing brackets.
- At every level of the recursion tree, we have two options based on the conditions above.

# Solution

**Time Complexity:** 
**Space Complexity:**

```python
def generate(op, cl, combi):
    if op == cl == 0:
        res.append(combi)
        return
    if op > 0:
        generate(op - 1, cl, combi + "(")
    if cl > op:
        generate(op, cl - 1, combi + ")")
res = []
generate(n, n, "")
return res
```
