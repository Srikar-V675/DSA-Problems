# Problem Definition

**Leetcode Link:** [Implement Stack using Queue](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-stack-using-queues/)

**Solution Link:** [Neetcode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rW4vm0-DLYc)

Implement a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack using only two queues. The implemented stack should support all the functions of a normal stack (push, top, pop, and empty).

**Implement the MyStack class:**

- void push(int x) Pushes element x to the top of the stack.
- int pop() Removes the element on the top of the stack and returns it.
- int top() Returns the element on the top of the stack.
- boolean empty() Returns true if the stack is empty, false otherwise.

**Notes:**

You must use only standard operations of a queue, which means that only push to back, peek/pop from front, size and is empty operations are valid.
Depending on your language, the queue may not be supported natively. You may simulate a queue using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a queue's standard operations.
 

Example 1:
```
Input
["MyStack", "push", "push", "top", "pop", "empty"]
[[], [1], [2], [], [], []]
Output
[null, null, null, 2, 2, false]

Explanation
MyStack myStack = new MyStack();
myStack.push(1);
myStack.push(2);
myStack.top(); // return 2
myStack.pop(); // return 2
myStack.empty(); // return False
```

# Approach

- I was stuck a little trying to figure out how do make sure I do the push and pop operations to be O(1) time.
- But I got to know that was impossible.
- The question suggests to use 2 queues and the follow up is to use a single queue. Using 2 queues just confuses you so I went directly with trying the single queue.

- In the above example of a queue we can see that if this was a stack and we need to pop then we need `7` but since it is a queue and we can only dequeue from head we get `1`.
- But if we reverse the queue then we see that we get our top of the stack at the place we can dequeue.
- My solution is: O(n) push and O(1) pop, you can also do the opposite.
- Whenever we push a new element to queue, we reverse the queue by performing (n-1) operations of pop from head and append to tail. this will reverse the queue.

# Solution

```python
from collections import deque
class MyStack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.q = deque()

    def push(self, x: int) -> None:
        self.q.append(x)
        for _ in range(len(self.q) - 1):
            self.q.append(self.q.popleft())

    def pop(self) -> int:
        return self.q.popleft()

    def top(self) -> int:
        return self.q[0]

    def empty(self) -> bool:
        return False if self.q else True
```
