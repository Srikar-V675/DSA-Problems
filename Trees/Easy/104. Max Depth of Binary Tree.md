# Problem Definition

**Leetcode Link:** [Max Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/description/)

**Solution Link:** [Neetcode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTM3phVI6YQ)

Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Example 1:
```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 3
```

Example 2:
```
Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: 2
```

# Approach

- We have three approaches and all of them more or less have the same complexities.

**Recursive DFS:**
- The question itself says `max-depth` so why not `depth-first search` that's the first thing that anyone would think of.
- We know the base case would be when `curNode` is None, we return 0, if we consider each node as a subtree then teh base case makes more sense.
- Let's take it in the POV of the root node, what is the depth it should be added with such that we get the max-depth, easy the depth of the subtree with max depth i.e either left or right. What do we need to add depth of root which is? 1.
- So every time we need to add 1 to the max depth of left subtree and right subtree.

**Iterative BFS:**
- When we are doing level-order traversal we know we are going level by level right? and we reach the max-depth when we reach the leaf of last level? 
- Why not update level by 1 every time the dfs goes to next level, this way we will get the max-depth.

**Iterative DFS(pre-order):**
- We know dfs is the best approach for this.
- Why not do it iteratively and since we need to access the root before the children we will go with pre-order traversal which is also the easiest to implement.
- Use a stack to emulate the recursive call stack. Only thing where we might get confused is in iterative approach we need to push the right first to stack before left to make sure the left gets process first.

# Solution

**Time Complexity:** O(N)

**Space Complexity:** *Recursive:* O(h) | *Iterative:* O(h), where `h` is the height of the tree. O(n) if skewed binary tree.

**Recursive DFS:**
```python
def maxDepth(root):
    if not root:
        return 0
    return 1 + max(maxDepth(root.left), maxDepth(root.right))
```

**Iterative BFS:**
```python
if not root:
    return 0
q = deque([root])
level = 0
while q:
    for _ in range(len(q)):
        node = q.popleft()
        if node.left:
            q.append(node.left)
        if node.right:
            q.append(node.right)
    level += 1
return level
```

**Iterative DFS(pre-order):**
```python
if not root:
    return 0
stack = [root, 1]
res = 0
while stack:
    node, depth = stack.pop()
    res = max(res, depth)
    if node.right:
        stack.append([node.right, depth+1])
    if node.left:
        stack.append([node.left, depth+1])
return res
```
